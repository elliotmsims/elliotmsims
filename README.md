## About Me :cowboy_hat_face:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliotmsims/

> Howdy! My name is Elliot Sims, and I am a graduating computer science major at the University of Texas in Austin. I was Texas born-and-raised but look forward to exploring and seeing more of what the world has to offer. Besides traveling, my other passions are athletics (basketball, soccer, lifting weights) and reading (favorite novel currently: The Silent Patient). Also, I have been recently interested in ElevenLabs AI Voice Cloning. Influenced by the social media trend, my roommates and I have been having a blast generating different Presidents' voices.

> My career-based interests are focused around software engineering/design. My past experience was working as a Full Stack Software Engineer developing an Anuglar app with ASP.NET Core backend and also creating personal, fun iOS and web apps. However, my favorite college course at UT was Cloud Computing/Engineering, which got me intrigued by the growing cloud environment.
